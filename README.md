### Hi Everyone!! 👋 I am Sudha Madhuri Poojari
A Fullstack developer from Stockholm, Sweden 

**About Me**
Originally from India 🇮🇳 and living in Sweden 🇸🇪. 

I am a versatile professional with a background in **Mechanical Engineering** and a passion for technology and web development. My journey into the tech industry began with a role as a Technical Writer, where I honed my ability to effectively communicate complex information.

Driven by a desire to broaden my skill set, I pursued a diploma in **Frontend Development** 👨‍💻 at Hyper Island in Stockholm. This intensive program provided me with hands-on experience in building modern and visually appealing web applications, using technologies such as React, Javascript, Figma and HTML/CSS.

Currently, I am thriving as a Full Stack Developer at Salt organization, where I actively contribute to the development of innovative and scalable web solutions. 

Through my diverse experiences and continuous learning, I bring a unique blend of technical knowledge, creative problem-solving skills, and effective communication to every project I undertake.

🌱 I’m currently learning SpringBoot
